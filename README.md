## This project features a React Three Fiber–powered 3D lanyard animation integrated into a modern developer portfolio. It’s fully responsive, optimized for desktop and mobile, and designed to showcase smooth physics and realistic motion using Rapier Physics and Three.js.

### Features

Interactive 3D Model — Click and drag on desktop to move the lanyard in real time.

Physics Simulation — Built using Rapier for natural rope and gravity motion.

Responsive Layout — Scales perfectly across devices and browsers.

Performance Optimized — Uses dynamic rendering, lazy loading, and ambient lighting.

Mobile Mode — Automatically disables interaction on mobile for smoother experience.
